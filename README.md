This code is for our paper called "Runtime and reconfiguration dual-aware placement for SRAM-NVM hybrid FPGAs." In this code, we
modified the open source tool called VTR to adapt for our experiments. Firstly, we make VTR adapt the emerging Non-volatile FPGA 
architecture by changing the input configuration codes; and we optimize the code of routing and placing algorithm to make VTR 
runtime and reconfiguration aware.
